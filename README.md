# Jira 2 Things CLI

> This is the source code for Jira 2 Things CLI

## üë®‚Äçüíª About

This CLI application is created with Node.js. It's sole purpose it to get all the tasks for a given user from a sprint in Jira and create a new project for them in Things 3 for Mac; each story is given it's own heading with the tasks nested beneath it within the project.

At the moment there are no plans to sync back any changes in Things back to Jira.

> This currently creates a new project each time the script is run. This is an outstanding to-do to allow updating.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Prerequisites

#### Atlassian

You must have access to an Atlassian account, active Sprint Board and be able to generate an API token.

#### Internet

The development process for this application requires an internet connection in order to fetch data from Atlassian.

### Setup

Once you have cloned the repository, install the node dependencies from the root directory.

```bash
$ yarn install
# or with npm
$ npm install
```

You will need to create a `.env` for development by copying `example.env` at the root of the project and provide the required environment variables. Some values in the `example.env` have been pre-populated or partially pre-populated for ease.

#### Environment Variables

| Variable           | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Development

To start the application, run the following from the project root:

```bash
# launch gatsby development server
$ yarn start
# or with npm
$ npm run start
```

> You will need to add a Sprint ID as an argument to the start command e.g `"start": "node index.js 1234"` where `1234` is the Sprint ID. For information on how to get a Sprint ID, please see [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/jira-software-how-to-search-for-a-sprint-using-jql-779159065.html).

Alternatively you can use [yarn link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link/) or [npm-link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link). Using this method you can then run `j2t` followed by a Sprint ID from anywhere in the terminal.
